Known problems and solutions:

Problem 1:
if you see the following when running ./run.py
"bash: ./run.py: Permission denied"

-> Solution:
chmod +x run.py
(alternatively you can use "python run.py")

Problem 2: cannot find module
"ImportError: No module named matplotlib.mlab"

-> Solution:
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
("pip install matplotlib" results in a bug "ImportError: No module named functools_lru_cache" at run-time in Ubuntu in my case)
