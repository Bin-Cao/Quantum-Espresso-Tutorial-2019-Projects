Here are the input and output files of the Quantum Espresso tutorial in youtube channel "QuantumNerd". You are very welcome to visit the channel:

The structure may be a little bit different than in the youtube playlist, but it should not be difficult to find the corresponding project according to the title of the folder. If you cannot find a certain file or you find some mistake, please feel free to comment in my youtube tutorial. 

Some utility tools can be found in the folder tools, including:
1. cp2xsf.f90 for outputing .asxf animation in a cp.x simulation
2. Bands.py for plotting the band structure
