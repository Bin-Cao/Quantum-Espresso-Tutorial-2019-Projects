STEP 1: vc-relax calculation
pw.x -inp graphene.1_vc_relax.in > graphene.1_vc_relax.out

STEP 2: scf calculation
pw.x -inp graphene.2_scf.in > graphene.2_scf.out

(optional: do one nscf calculation to get more precise Fermi energy)

STEP 3: bands calculation (for a given k-path)
pw.x -inp graphene.3_bands.in > graphene.3_bands.out

STEP 4: bands post-processing
bands.x -inp graphene.4_bands_pp.in > graphene.4_bands_pp.out

STEP 5: plot band (no mpirun)
plotband.x < graphene.5_plotband.in > graphene.5_plotband.out
