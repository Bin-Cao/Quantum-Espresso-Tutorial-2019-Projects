###calculation of the energy barrier of single vacancy migration/diffusion in Si crystal using neb.x

###reference: 0.3~0.45eV (experiments and previous calculations)

step 0:
construct a 2by2by2 supercell
take one atom away, relax (as first image in step 1)
take another atom (neighboring) away instead (as last image in step 1)

step 1:
neb.x calculation without climbing image (CI)
-> result: 0.292768 eV

step 2:
refine the calculation with CI
-> result: 0.2892 eV
